I am Jessica and my background is mostly in hospitality, sales and marketing.
My career goals are to follow an entrepreneurial path in the fintech industry. I am currently working towards foreign exchange trading but would like to learn other skills as well 
I choose fintech as a career path because I enjoy learning about finance and have a personal interest in technology
