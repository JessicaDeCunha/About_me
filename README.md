# About Me


I am a growing FinTech enthusiast with the ambition of becoming an entrepreneurial algorithmic trader. Coming from a Bachelor of Commerce from the University of Guelph, I am currently exploring a passion for finance technologies through self-study of foreign exchange trading, as well as an intensive FinTech program offered through The University of Toronto. Both these sources of education have provided me with exposure and insight into finance and economics with technical skills in financial programming, financial machine learning, blockchain, and cryptocurrency.

Throughout my professional and academic journey, I have been recognized for interpersonal skills, teamwork, effective time management, critical thinking, and problem-solving through academic scholarships and consulting projects for business development. My motivation for pursuing a career in FinTech is that I believe this industry has the potential to be one of the gateways to solving major global issues such as the cycle of poverty. Once a goal like that has been reached, I would like to be a part of the team that can say, I contributed to that achievement.
